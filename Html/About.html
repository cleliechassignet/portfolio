                <h2>THE WALTZ OF MY LIFE</h2>
                <p>Creative student, with a <strong>SCIENTIFIC</strong> and <strong>ARTISTIC</strong> background, i'm currently in the second year of 
                    IMAC (Image Multimedia Audiovisuel Communication) engineering school. I'm interested in mixing <strong>CULTURES</strong> and knowledges. 
                    <br>
                    <span> I'm sensitive to all kind of <strong>ART</strong>, especially the field of cinema. </span> 
                </p>
                <p class="last_p"> As an IMAC student, I treat the image in its different aspects. 
                    Sensitive to art, I draw my inspiration from the culture offered by museums, dance, cinema, music, Â travels and many other fields.
                    <br>
                    I try to put forward my creativity supported by my scientific skills.
                    <br> My research focuses primarily on the work of lights, frame and colors.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I tend to stage the Beautiful by adapting myself to the different aesthetics that catch my eye.
